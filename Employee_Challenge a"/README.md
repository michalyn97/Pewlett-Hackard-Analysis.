##Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

##Results
The results show that most of the employees that are eligible for retirement are "Baby Boomers" and Senior Staff.
There appears to be a big gap between Assistant Engineers and Senior Engineer positions that are filled.   
Only having 2 employees that are managers may be a direct result from over half of your employees being Senior Engineers.

Prior to the Senior Staff's retirement, you may want to link some of them with new employees as a lot of wisdom and knowledge will be leaving the company.

#Conclusion
An Overview of the data illulstrates that there may not be enough staff to cover the "Silver Tsuami".  The implementation of a better training program that includes some of the Senior Engineers will be beneficial as over 60% of the staff is eligible for retirement.   
You may also want to consider better technology as some of the tasks that were handled by Senior Engineers could possibly be automated.
